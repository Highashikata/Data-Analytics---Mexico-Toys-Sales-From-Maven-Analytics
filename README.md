### Loading & transforming the Data
In this step, since we have a csv files, we will begin by importing the 4 csv files of our tables, and we will analyse the different data and we will try to apply the different transformations, like changing data types, setting the first row as header if needed,
replacing Null values either by 0 or N/A, creating custom columns if needed for our analysis, columns by example and so on.
